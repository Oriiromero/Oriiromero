### Hi there, I'm Oriana! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior web developer based in Madrid, currently juggling between my internship and personal projects. Here's a bit about what's going on in my coding world:

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently immersed in the world of web development, tackling projects that involve both front-end and back-end magic. I'm getting cozy with PHP Laravel and MySQL for the backend, and React with TypeScript for the frontend. Bonus points for my newfound love for building UIs with Material UI components!

- ðŸŒ± I'm on a mission to level up my skills, especially in handling larger projects. I'm always open to learning and exploring new technologies.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm keen on collaborating with fellow developers on projects that spark creativity and innovation. If you share an interest in PHP, Laravel, React, or just coding in general, let's team up!

- ðŸ¤” While I've made strides, logic is still a bit of a puzzle for me. I'm actively seeking guidance and insights in this area. If you're a logic wizard, I'd love to pick your brain!

- ðŸ’¬ The project I'm most proud of is the one I'm currently working on during my internship. It's been a challenging journey, but the lessons learned have been invaluable.

- ðŸ“« Let's connect! Feel free to reach out if you're interested in a coding collaboration or just want to chat about the latest tech trends. You can find me in Madrid, or drop me a message oriana.nahir.r@gmail.com

- ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: I believe the best ideas emerge when fueled by a good cup of coffee! â˜•

Looking forward to connecting with fellow developers and creating some coding magic!
